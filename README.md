# Happy-Mothers-Day
This is a personal project I created the summer before I began my CS degree at USC. I used Turtles in Java to draw a picture with text and flowers. The petals and pistils of the flowers have random lengths and colors for variety. 

This project was writtten in BlueJ and must be executed in BlueJ by running the main method.

Here is a picture of the output:
